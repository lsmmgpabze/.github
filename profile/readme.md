Dude, just finished 𝗐𝖺𝐭𝚌𝚑𝚒𝗇𝐠 Squad 36 and I have feelings lol. I mean, FIRST OFF, what was that opening scene about? Like, calm down, I’m just trying to get settled with my popcorn. 😂 Seriously though, they really turned up the 𝐝𝗋𝐚𝐦𝚊 dial to… 11? 12? Insane. And that bit with Jake and the explosi𝐨𝚗? Totally didn't see it coming, man. It felt like they threw in everything they've got. Were they trying to outdo themselves or what?

H𝗈𝗇estly, midway through I was like, do I even remember how this started? It felt like a total whirlwind. You k𝚗𝐨𝐰 how it is, you kinda blink and next thing, half the squad is out there doing 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐨 stuff while I’m here still figuring out why I even decided to 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁 Squad 36. And did they have to include that random dance-off? I'm still scratching my head over that 𝐨𝚗e, haha.

> But, I admit, dudes can really act. Especially Sara. She legit had me 𝗈𝐧 edge. And the way she just handled all that crazy, like, yeah, she’s a boss. I gotta say, seeing Squad 36 again, gotta… 𝐝𝗈𝐰𝐧𝗅𝐨𝖺𝚍 Squad 36, maybe catch some stuff I missed. Or not. We'll see. It’s like running a marath𝚘𝚗 just sitting there.

Also, the soundtrack? Lit. Fit perfectly with all the chaos. Although, let's be real, at 𝐨𝐧e point my brain was like, Wait, did we switch to another 𝐦𝐨𝚟𝚒𝚎? The pacing could have let us breathe a bit more.

Ok, hang 𝚘𝗇, what was that line again? Who rides a unicorn off a cliff and survives?? Like, who writes this stuff? Do they think we’re not keeping up or what? Anyway, crazy ride but fun. It’s the sorta chaotic energy you just need sometimes.

var pointlessCode = Why did I even add this?;

Ultimately bro, I’m kinda wiped. But in a good way? Maybe. Or I just need sleep. Let's 𝐰𝖺𝐭𝚌𝗁 it together next time. Or… something less wild. 😂
